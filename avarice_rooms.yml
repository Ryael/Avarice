From what you remember\napproaching it from outside, its age is apparent: decaying\nbrick and shattered windows, with nature attempting to\nreclaim its lost territory as vines crawl up its sides,\ncapturing it in its claws like a predator.\n\nAn old ladder, your only apparent escape, seems tall\nenough to reach none of the windows. It looks as if you\nmight be able to use it to escape.\n\nYou hear faint noises coming from the south. Best to\nget a move on and investigate."
